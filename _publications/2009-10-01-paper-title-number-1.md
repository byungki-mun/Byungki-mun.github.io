This paper examines how the US-China tariff war has reshaped the skill demands of U.S. firms. It focuses on the effects of tariffs on hiring patterns, workforce composition, and the adoption of specific skillsets across various industries. By analyzing job posting data and firm-level responses, this study aims to uncover the extent to which trade policy shocks influence labor demand and the skill upgrading or downgrading of U.S. firms' workforces.
