 Immigrants constitute an increasingly significant portion of the U.S. population and workforce. By March 2019, approximately 39 million foreign-born working-age individuals were in the U.S., making up 18.4 percent of the working-age population. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent border closures and immigration ban reversed this trend, reducing the number of working-age foreign-born individuals by over 2 million in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic projections. This paper explores the impact of COVID-19  border closures and immigration restrictions on U.S. labor markets. Using data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) and Burning Glass's (BG) online job postings, our methodology employs panel regression, difference-in-differences (DiD), and an event-study design, leveraging both the geographic and temporal variation in the foreign-born share before and after immigration restrictions. I analyze changes in the immigrant demographics by education, gender, region, and occupation, as well as the effects on native employment, wage growth, and employers' skill demand. I find that the drop in immigration increased native employment and decreased foreign-born employment, suggesting a substitution effect and leading to disproportionate wage growth. This overall substitution effect contrasts with the within-occupation findings, where immigration restrictions reduce native employment. Additionally, immigrant shortages accelerated firms' adoption of new technologies and automation over time, significantly altering skill requirements in affected regions and occupations.

Using online job vacancy data, I study how the dramatic local employment shock due to the pandemic changed labor demand and how the COVID-19 pandemic differs from the impact of the Great Recession on the labor market. I find that the downskilling of education and experience requirements during the pandemic sharply contrasts with persistent upskilling after the Great Recession. The downskilling effects are more prevalent in industries with traded products and routine-manual jobs such as healthcare, logistics, retail, and construction. Labor shortages promote job automation and downskilling, and firms' adoption of new technologies and workers' acquisition of new skills are concentrated on practical skills such as Business Systems, Data Analysis, Specialized Software, ML/AI, not education degrees, during the pandemic.

This paper revisits previous findings and examines whether the trade exposure to increased import competition has a significant impact on the local labor markets. The previous literature showed that higher imports from China cause higher unemployment, reduced wages, the relative reduction in population growth in the U.S. local labor markets, where the import competitive manufacturing industry resides. I repeat the specification of Autor et al. (2013) and Greenland et al. (2019), but I extend the period from 1990-2007 to 1990-2010 and incorporate alternative measures of trade exposure for U.S. commuting zones. The coefficient on manufacturing employment in the working-age population of the Chinese comparative advantage model is -0.305, which is less than half (43%) of the gross Chinese imports model. Although trade exposure reduces manufacturing employment, in models using net Chinese exports per worker or exposure to final goods and intermediate inputs, trade exposure was found to have a statistically significant positive effect on average manufacturing wages. When controlling preexisting population trends, the coefficient on trade exposures for CZ population adjustments using domestic plus international exposure to Chinese exports and the coefficient of the model using change in comparative advantage China-US are reduced to 57% and 28% of that in the model using Chinese imports per worker, respectively. In both IPUMS data and Census data, I find significant reductions in population growth of working-age individuals and of the young.
