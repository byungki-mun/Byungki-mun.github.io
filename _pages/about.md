I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Virginia Tech. I am also a Research Affiliate at the Global Labor Organization (GLO).

My research covers Labor Economics and International Trade in political and economic situations. My research interests focus on the effects of technological innovation, immigration, and international trade on the labor market. I am currently working on projects examining how the COVID-19 pandemic and immigration restrictions affect the labor market and skill demand, as well as technology adoption.

I have worked as a senior researcher for ten years at the Institute for International Trade in KITA (Korea International Trade Association), the largest economic organization in South Korea with over 73,000 member companies. I have been awarded commendations from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance (MOF) of Korea and the Minister of Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of Korea. I served in the military as a naval officer of the Republic of Korea for three years and four months. I was a Frédéric Bastiat Fellow with the Mercatus Center at George Mason University during the 2022-2023 academic year.
